**Author: Isabella Tannus Correa**

Database contain case reports in Brazil. 

The database and pre-process is available in three different formats:
* **reports db:** all of the collected cases in their original format, separated by general, constant and sporadic (classification done manually by me).
* **java process:** contains the pre-processed database with an algorithm written in Java, the stemmed database, word clouds and the execution of the LDA
* **python process:** contains the pre-processed database with an algorithm written in Python, the stemmed database, word clouds and the execution of the LDA

You can [read the abstract](https://bellatannus.github.io/pesquisas.html) (in Portuguese) and understand how I used the database in my paper.
